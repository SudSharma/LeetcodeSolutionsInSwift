 Given a m * n matrix mat of ones (representing soldiers) and zeros (representing civilians), return the indexes of the k weakest rows in the matrix ordered from the weakest to the strongest.

 A row i is weaker than row j, if the number of soldiers in row i is less than the number of soldiers in row j, or they have the same number of soldiers but i is less than j. Soldiers are always stand in the frontier of a row, that is, always ones may appear first and then zeros.

  

 Example 1:

 Input: mat =
 [[1,1,0,0,0],
  [1,1,1,1,0],
  [1,0,0,0,0],
  [1,1,0,0,0],
  [1,1,1,1,1]],
 k = 3
 Output: [2,0,3]
 Explanation:
 The number of soldiers for each row is:
 row 0 -> 2
 row 1 -> 4
 row 2 -> 1
 row 3 -> 2
 row 4 -> 5
 Rows ordered from the weakest to the strongest are [2,0,3,1,4]
 Example 2:

 Input: mat =
 [[1,0,0,0],
  [1,1,1,1],
  [1,0,0,0],
  [1,0,0,0]],
 k = 2
 Output: [0,2]
 Explanation:
 The number of soldiers for each row is:
 row 0 -> 1
 row 1 -> 4
 row 2 -> 1
 row 3 -> 1
 Rows ordered from the weakest to the strongest are [0,2,3,1]
  

 Constraints:

 m == mat.length
 n == mat[i].length
 2 <= n, m <= 100
 1 <= k <= m
 matrix[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
