 Suppose you have n integers from 1 to n. We define a beautiful arrangement as an array that is constructed by these n numbers successfully if one of the following is true for the ith position (1 <= i <= n) in this array:

 The number at the ith position is divisible by i.
 i is divisible by the number at the ith position.
 Given an integer n, return the number of the beautiful arrangements that you can construct.

  

 Example 1:

 Input: n = 2
 Output: 2
 Explanation:
 The first beautiful arrangement is [1, 2]:
 Number at the 1st position (i=1) is 1, and 1 is divisible by i (i=1).
 Number at the 2nd position (i=2) is 2, and 2 is divisible by i (i=2).
 The second beautiful arrangement is [2, 1]:
 Number at the 1st position (i=1) is 2, and 2 is divisible by i (i=1).
 Number at the 2nd position (i=2) is 1, and i (i=2) is divisible by 1.
 Example 2:

 Input: n = 1
 Output: 1
  

 Constraints:

 1 <= n <= 15
