 Given two lists Aand B, and B is an anagram of A. B is an anagram of A means B is made by randomizing the order of the elements in A.

 We want to find an index mapping P, from A to B. A mapping P[i] = j means the ith element in A appears in B at index j.

 These lists A and B may contain duplicates. If there are multiple answers, output any of them.

 For example, given

 A = [12, 28, 46, 32, 50]
 B = [50, 12, 32, 46, 28]
 We should return
 [1, 4, 3, 2, 0]
 as P[0] = 1 because the 0th element of A appears at B[1], and P[1] = 4 because the 1st element of A appears at B[4], and so on.
 Note:

 A, B have equal lengths in range [1, 100].
 A[i], B[i] are integers in range [0, 10^5].

    func anagramMappings(_ A: [Int], _ B: [Int]) -> [Int] {
        var anagramMappings = [Int]()
        var dict: [Int: [Int]] = [:]
        
        var index = 0
        for num in B {
            if let _ = dict[num] {
                dict[num]?.append(index)
            }
            else {
                dict[num] = [index]
            }
            index += 1
        }
        
        for num in A {
            if var value = dict[num] {
                anagramMappings.append(value.removeFirst())
            }
        }
